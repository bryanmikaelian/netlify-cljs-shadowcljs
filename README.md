# Commands

When developing locally, these commands can help you out:

### Watch

Watch and recompile your site as you make changes. You can visit your site at http://localhost:8700.

``` shell
yarn watch
```

## Clean

Removes artifacts that are generated by shadow-cljs and tailwind

``` shell
yarn clean
```

## Build

Builds the site for release. Netlify will use the same command when deploying

``` shell
yarn release
```

## Server

Runs a shadow-cljs server that hosts your app. Does not watch for changes. You can visit your site at http://localhost:8700.

``` shell
yarn release
```
